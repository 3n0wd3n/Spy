# Spy

A personal project to create a web-based game inspired by the spy concept. In the game, most players are given a secret word representing an object, while one player the spy has no idea what the word is. The spy's goal is to figure out the secret word, while the other players try to identify who the spy is. Both sides must carefully phrase their questions to avoid revealing either the word or their role.
